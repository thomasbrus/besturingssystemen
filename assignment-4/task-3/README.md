# Documentation on task 3

## How do we run it?

First, compile secret_string.c:

	$ gcc secret_string.c

Then, use the output of of this program as input to as4_t3.

	$ ./as4_t3 `./a.out`

a.out has now generated the correct string which is used to buffer overflow as4_t3.

## How does it work?

We have discovered that the first 108 chars of the string are used to get to the correct place in the stack. The last characters are used to "fil" int i. These characters are generated by setting a int to 0xdeadbeef and point a *char to it.
